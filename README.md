## Methodology

- **News Collection:** We collected news related to the automotive industry, covering a variety of brands and manufacturers.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Each news article was subjected to automated sentiment analysis to determine whether the report was perceived as positive or negative in relation to the mentioned brand.

- News highlighting innovations, launches of electric and hybrid vehicles, performance improvements, and sales success are generally perceived as positive. This can strengthen the brand's image and attract consumers interested in innovation and performance.

### Negative Impact

- News reporting problems, challenges, or criticisms, such as safety issues, depreciation, or regulatory obstacles, tend to be perceived as negative. This can negatively affect the brand's reputation and influence the purchase decision.

### Innovation and Electrification

- Emphasis on innovation and electrification is generally perceived positively, reflecting the growing demand for electric and sustainable vehicles.

### Regulatory and Environmental Challenges

- Regulatory and environmental issues can negatively impact brand perception. Companies demonstrating a commitment to sustainability can mitigate this impact.

## Conclusion

Analyzing how news and media reports are perceived in relation to automotive brands is essential to understanding how this information influences consumer decisions. Brands that stand out in innovation, sustainability, and performance are generally perceived positively, while regulatory and environmental challenges can have a negative impact on brand reputation.
